He who has seen everything, I will make known to the lands.
I will teach about him who experienced all things,
alike, Anu granted him the totality of knowledge of all.
He saw the Secret, discovered the Hidden, he brought information of the time before the Flood.
He went on a distant journey, pushing himself to exhaustion, but then was brought to peace.
He carved on a stone stela all of his toils,
and built the wall of Uruk-Haven, the wall of the sacred Eanna Temple, the holy sanctuary.
Look at its wall which gleams like copper,
inspect its inner wall, the likes of which no one can equal!
Take hold of the threshold stone--it dates from ancient times!
Go close to the Eanna Temple, the residence of Ishtar,
such as no later king or man ever equaled!
Go up on the wall of Uruk and walk around,
examine its foundation, inspect its brickwork thoroughly.
Is not even the core of the brick structure made of kiln-fired brick,
and did not the Seven Sages themselves lay out its plans?
One league city, one league palm gardens, one league lowlands, the open area of the Ishtar Temple,
three leagues and the open area of Uruk it encloses.
Find the copper tablet box,
open the ... of its lock of bronze,
undo the fastening of its secret opening.
Take and read out from the lapis lazuli tablet
how Gilgamesh went through every hardship.
Supreme over other kings, lordly in appearance,
he is the hero, born of Uruk, the goring wild bull.
He walks out in front, the leader,
and walks at the rear, trusted by his companions.
Mighty net, protector of his people,
raging flood-wave who destroys even walls of stone!
Offspring of Lugalbanda, Gilgamesh is strong to perfection,
son of the august cow, Rimat-Ninsun; Gilgamesh is awesome to perfection.
It was he who opened the mountain passes,
who dug wells on the flank of the mountain.
It was he who crossed the ocean, the vast seas, to the sunrise,
who explored the regions of the world seeking life.
It was he who reached by his own sheer strength Utanapishtim, the Faraway,
who restored the sanctuaries or cities that the Flood had destroyed!
for teeming mankind.
Who can compare with him in kingliness?
Who can say like Gilgamesh: "I am King!"?
Whose name, from the day of his birth, was called "Gilgamesh"?
Two-thirds of him is god, one-third of him is human.
The Great Goddess Aruru designed the model for his body,
she prepared his form
beautiful, handsomest of men,
perfect
He walks around in the enclosure of Uruk,
like a wild bull he makes himself mighty, head raised over others.
There is no rival who can raise his weapon against him.
His fellows stand at the alert, attentive to his orders,
and the men of Uruk become anxious in
Gilgamesh does not leave a son to his father,
day and night he arrogantly
Is he the shepherd of Uruk-Haven,
is he their shepherd
bold, eminent, knowing, and wise,
Gilgamesh does not leave a girl to her mother
The daughter of the warrior, the bride of the young man,
the gods kept hearing their complaints, so
the gods of the heavens implored the Lord of Uruk Anu
"You have indeed brought into being a mighty wild bull
